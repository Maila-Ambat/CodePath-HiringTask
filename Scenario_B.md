Hi Jane,

Thank you for reaching out. I appreciate your interest and effort in completing all the necessary steps in the application process to the course Pathway: Android Development.

Our courses are specifically targeted at students enrolled in our partner universities in the United States and Puerto Rico. You can check the [Eligibility Requirements](https://support.codepath.org/hc/en-us/articles/10451498702363-Android-Development-Eligibility-Requirements) for clarity.

We acknowledge your desire to attend the course and learn from it. If you sign up for our [mailing list](https://www.codepath.org/join-our-mailing-list), you will be notified when classes become available in your area powered by local organizers or through remote means. Know that we, too, have ambitions to expand to more countries in the future.

In the meantime, there are a lot of resources out there for people interested in learning Android Development. We have an extensive [list of Android resources online](https://guides.codepath.com/android/Beginning-Android-Resources#beginning-android-resources) and did some work to make them more accessible.

We hope to be able to bring programs to your area soon and expand our audience for future programs.

Thank you for your understanding.

<br/>All the best,
<br/>CodePath.org Team
