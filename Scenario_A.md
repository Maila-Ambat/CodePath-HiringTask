**Scenario_A**

Hi John,

Thank you for reaching out. I understand you are requesting to be moved from the Intermediate Track to the Advanced Track of the Technical Interview Prep program.

There are requirements, expectations, and goals to consider your eligibility for each course level. You can check the course description below. The first few topics are similar, but the pacing of the track depends greatly on the level of the course.

- [Intermediate Technical Interview Prep (TIP102)](https://courses.codepath.org/snippets/tip102/syllabus)
- [Advanced Technical Interview Prep (TIP 103)](https://courses.codepath.org/snippets/tip103/syllabus)

We admit students based on the technical interview skills. We don’t want to put them into a class that’s either too advanced or too basic so that they get the best experience possible. And based on your pre-work score, you only qualify for the Intermediate Track.

We hope this answers your concern and we look forward to seeing you in class.

<br/>All the best,
CodePath.org Team
