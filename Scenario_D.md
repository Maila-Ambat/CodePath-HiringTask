**Scenario_D**

Hi Dennis,

Thank you for reaching out. I understand you want to be reinstated back to the TIP101 (Intro to Technical Interview Prep) course.

As you know, complete and on-time assignment submission is core to our educational model. Missing one assignment will result in removal from the course as outlined in our [course policies](https://courses.codepath.org/snippets/ios_university/policies_remote_fall19). We believe that success in the industry goes beyond proficiency in technical domains. The ability to be punctual, meet project deadlines, and work effectively in a collaborative team are equally important skills.

You were dropped from the class due to non-compliance with the course policy for missing coursework. We reached out to you via email and Slack requesting an explanation as to why you were not able to submit the coursework, but we did not receive a reply. Hence, we can no longer re-admit you.

Moving forward, you will have lifetime access to the course material. Kindly use your GitHub login credentials with CodePath.

Thank you for your understanding.

<br/>All the best,
CodePath.org Team
