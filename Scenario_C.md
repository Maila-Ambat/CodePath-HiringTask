**Scenario_C**

Hi Anne,

We appreciate your interest in our Summer Interview Prep course which will begin on June 4. We regret that you missed the deadline for the application. The class is full and we already have a long waitlist.

Normally, we would invite applicants to apply again next year since we run this course every summer. However, I understand that you are graduating this Spring.

As this is important to you, we would like to share our [high-level software interview guide](https://hackmd.io/@nesquena/HJN9k17sm?type=view) containing tips and guidelines that might be helpful to finally get you an offer for an internship program. Check out CodePathâ€™s [resources page](https://support.codepath.org/hc/en-us/categories/11310239595931-Career-Center) for more articles relevant to you. You can also sign up for our [mailing list](https://www.codepath.org/join-our-mailing-list) for future courses or virtual events that might interest you.

I hope this helps and I wish you all the best in your future endeavors.

<br/>Regards,
<br/>CodePath.org Team
